The cart items stored by anoynimous  users should be stored
 in cookies so that when site is closed stil the data is
  contained in the user's browser story area.

document.cookie.split(';')
what it does is that it separates the cookie into a string like below
["csrftoken=abc123", " sessionid=xyz456", " cart=3"] so that we can iterate over it.

now I've created a functionality to add and delete cookie
in main.html the fuction get cookie gets the cookie named cart.
The cart variable holds the object notation of the cart cookie parsed.
And then we check whether the cookie named cart exists or not. If not we create one as empty.

Then in cart.js we had creted a updatecart function that sent post request to the server when we clicked a button with update-cart class
when the user was anonymous we has ignored the functionlaity but now we created a addCookieItem function that adds or removes the quantity
 of the items whoose effect can be seen over cookie in the broswer
